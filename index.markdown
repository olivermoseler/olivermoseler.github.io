Hi, my name is <b>Oliver Moseler</b>,<br/>
<br/>

I am a doctoral researcher and teaching assistant at the Software Engineering Group of the <a href="https://www.st.uni-trier.de" target="_blank">University of Trier</a>, Germany.

My research is related to the static and dynamic analysis of programs as well as the visualization of software metrics to support the software debugging process.
Therefore, the development of novel (visual) debugging approaches, their implementation in tools close to integrated development environments and their evaluation is my main research concern.
In particular, I focus on performance, concurrency and synchronization in the Java world, i.e. the dynamic analysis of multithreaded Java programs and related concurrency as well as performance bugs.
