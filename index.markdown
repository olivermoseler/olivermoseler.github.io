Hi, my name is <b>Oliver Moseler</b>,<br/>
<br/>

I am a doctoral researcher and teaching assistant in the Software-Engineering Group at the <a href="https://www.st.uni-trier.de" target="_blank">University of Trier</a>, Germany.

My research is related to the static and dynamic analysis of programs as well as the visualization of software metrics to support code-related software development tasks.
In particular, the design and development of novel debugging approaches using visualizations, their implementation in tools close to integrated development environments and their evaluation is my main research interest.


Lately I have been focusing on performance, concurrency and synchronization in the Java world, i.e. the dynamic analysis of multithreaded Java programs and related concurrency and performance bugs.
